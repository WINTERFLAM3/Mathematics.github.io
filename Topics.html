        <p>Mathematics is a discipline that deals with numbers, quantities, structures, patterns, and their relationships. It is often referred to as the language of science and is used to describe and understand various phenomena in the natural world. Mathematics is not limited to calculations and formulas; it encompasses abstract concepts, logical reasoning, and problem-solving techniques.</p>		
	</section>
	<section>
	    <p>Mathematics can be divided into several branches or areas, including:</p>
		<div class = "DIV" style="background-color: red;">
		    <p>Arithmetic: The study of basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as properties of numbers.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "DIV" style="background-color: orange;">
		    <p>Algebra: The branch of mathematics that deals with symbols, variables, and equations, exploring relationships and manipulating mathematical expressions.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "DIV" style="background-color: yellow;">
		    <p>Geometry: The study of shapes, sizes, and properties of figures and spaces, including angles, lines, curves, and their measurements.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "DIV" style="background-color: green;">
		    <p>Calculus: The branch that focuses on rates of change and accumulation, involving concepts like derivatives, integrals, and limits.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "DIV" style="background-color: blue;">
		    <p>Statistics: The collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data to make inferences and draw conclusions about a population.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "DIV" style="background-color: indigo;">
		    <p>Probability: The study of uncertainty and the likelihood of events occurring, often used to analyze randomness and make predictions.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "DIV" style="background-color: purple;">
		    <p>Discrete Mathematics: The branch that deals with countable, distinct objects and structures, including logic, set theory, graph theory, and combinatorics.</p>
		</div>
