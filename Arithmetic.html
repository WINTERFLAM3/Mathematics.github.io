		<h2 class="Introduction">What is Arithmetic?</h2>
        <p>Arithmetic is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of numbers using various operations on them. Basic operations of math are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</p>

	<div class="DIV">
	<section>
	    <p>These operations are denoted by the given symbols.</p>

	    <h2 class="Introduction">Addition:</h2>
		<img class= "rotateImage" src="img/Addition.png">
		<p>- The addition is the process of taking two or more numbers and adding them together. In other words, it is the total sum of all the numbers.</p>
		<p>- Addition of whole numbers results in a number greater than the added numbers.</p>
		<h2 class="Introduction">Example:</h2>
		<p>If 3 kids were playing and after some time, 2 more kids join them. How many kids are there in total?</p>
		<p>This can be written as a mathematical expression as follows: 3 + 2 = 5; Thus, 5 kids are playing in total. </p>
	</section>
	<section>
	    <h2 class="Introduction">Subtraction:</h2>
		<img class= "rotateImage" src="img/Subtraction.png">
		<p>- Subtraction is the process in which we remove objects from the original group.</p>
		<p>- In subtraction, the numerical value of the original number becomes less.</p>
		<h2 class="Introduction">Example:</h2>
		<p>8 birds are sitting on a tree. After some time, 2 birds fly away. How many birds are on the tree?</p>
		<p>This can be written as a mathematical expression as follows: 8 – 2 = 6;  Hence, there are only 6 birds left on the tree.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	    <h2 class="Introduction">Multiplication:</h2>
		<img class= "rotateImage" src="img/Multiplication.png">
		<p>- Multiplication is adding the same number to itself a certain number of times.</p>
		<p>- When we multiply two numbers, the result is called a product.</p>
		<h2 class="Introduction">Example:</h2>
		<p>Robin went to the garden three times and brought 5 oranges each time. How many oranges in total did Robin bring? </p>
		<p>This can be written as a mathematical expression as follows: 5 × 3 = 15; Thus, Robin brought 15 oranges.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	    <h2 class="Introduction">Division:</h2>
		<img class= "rotateImage" src="img/Division.png">
		<p>- The division is breaking a large object or group into smaller parts or groups.</p>
		<p>- The number or the larger group that gets divided is known as the dividend.</p>
		<p>- The number that divides the dividend is known as the divisor.</p>
		<p>- The number obtained on dividing the dividend by a divisor is called the quotient.</p>
		<p>- The number left after dividing is called remainder.</p>
		<h2 class="Introduction">Example:</h2>
		<p>On distributing 26 strawberries among 6 children, how many strawberries each child gets? and how many strawberries are left?</p>
		<p>This can be written as a mathematical expression as follows: 26 / 6 = 4; 2 remainder; Thus, On distributing 26 strawberries among 6 children, each child gets 4 strawberries, and 2 strawberries are left.</p>
